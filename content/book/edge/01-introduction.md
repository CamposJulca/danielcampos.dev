## 1. Motivation

The exponential growth of connected devices and data-intensive applications has exposed fundamental limitations in traditional cloud-centric architectures.

Latency-sensitive systems, bandwidth constraints, privacy requirements, and operational costs motivate a shift toward **computing closer to data sources**.

Edge Computing emerges as a response to these constraints.

---

## 2. What is Edge Computing?

Edge Computing is a **distributed computing paradigm** in which computation, storage, and control are placed near the physical sources of data.

Rather than replacing cloud computing, Edge complements it by introducing **intermediate layers** between devices and centralized data centers.

---

## 3. Why Edge Matters

From an engineering perspective, Edge Computing addresses:

- **Latency reduction** for real-time systems  
- **Bandwidth optimization** by local processing  
- **Resilience** through decentralized operation  
- **Privacy and data sovereignty** constraints  

These properties are critical in cyber-physical systems, smart cities, and industrial automation.

## 4. Edge vs Cloud (Conceptual View)

| Aspect        | Cloud Computing        | Edge Computing           |
|---------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Latency       | High (network bound)   | Low (local processing)   |
| Scalability   | Centralized            | Distributed              |
| Control       | Central authority      | Hierarchical / local     |
| Fault impact  | Global                 | Localized                |

## 5. Scope of This Book

This book approaches Edge Computing from a **systems and control perspective**, emphasizing:

- Architectural design  
- Network-aware computation  
- Interaction with Software Defined Networking (SDN)  
- Practical experimentation over abstract theory  

Subsequent chapters will progressively introduce technical depth and real-world implementations.
