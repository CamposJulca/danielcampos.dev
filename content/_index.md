## Welcome

I am an engineer and researcher focused on **Edge Computing, Software Defined Networking (SDN)** and **distributed systems**.

This website serves three purposes:

- 📘 A **technical notebook** documenting systems and experiments  
- 🧠 A **living book** on Edge Computing and SDN  
- 💼 A **professional portfolio** of projects and research  

The content here is built progressively, with an emphasis on **engineering clarity, reproducibility and real systems**.

---

### What you will find here

- **Book**: structured notes on Edge Computing and SDN  
- **Blog**: short technical logs and experiments  
- **Portfolio**: selected projects and implementations  

This site is intentionally minimal: the focus is on **ideas and systems**, not decoration.
